WIP Way of me overengineering ways to make managing IOT devices automated. 

This project was a result of me not wanting to manually power on/baby sit my 3d printer and IOT devices.

The idea is that in the device config you can specify a wattage and state profile. Then N number of IOT devices can be made to follow specific profiles based on main device (3d Printer)
